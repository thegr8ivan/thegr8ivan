# 👋 Hey what's up, I'm Ivan Kamotho  

Welcome to my playground, where problems meet solutions and code meets coffee ☕. I’m just a guy who:  
- Wakes up early   
- Breaks codes for fun (and fixes them too, sometimes)  
- Believes that every great idea starts with a blank file and a steaming mug of coffee.
- Always plans to buy the latest coffee machine .

## 🚀 About Me
I'm all about **building stuff from scratch**, solving problems like a nicotine-fueled detective, and occasionally wondering why the code that "worked yesterday" doesn’t work today.  
Whether it’s debugging, learning, or just writing goofy comments in my code, I enjoy every bit of that, cause that's me.
My version of “Netflix and chill” is “console.log and debug.”  
I have a love-hate relationship with semicolons (`;`).


### **Specialties**:  
- 🛠 **JavaScript**: My go-to tool for making cool web stuff.  
- 🐍 **Python**: Who doesn't love writing code that looks like English?  
- 💻 **C#**: The new kid on my tech block—I’m learning it one `Hello, World!` at a time.

## 💻 My Workbench  
Here’s what’s always open on my desk (aside from my coffee cup):  

- 🖥️ Projects I’ve built from scratch because *why not?*  
- 🛠️ Fixing bugs and pretending I wrote the code right the first time.  
- 🌟 Having fun with coding challenges .  
 

### Thanks for stopping by, and remember: **Life’s too short to write boring code.**
